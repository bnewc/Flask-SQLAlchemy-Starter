# Flask-SQLAlchemy Starter

Code I use to start a Flask-SQLAlchemy app. Adapted from [cookiecutter-flask](https://github.com/cookiecutter-flask/cookiecutter-flask).

The most useful additions are found within `database.py`, which features numerous methods to abstract SQLAlchemy operations.

Requires creation of a local `.env` file with Flask-SQLAlchemy [configuration settings](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/config/).

Read [Flask-SQLAlchemy docs](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/quickstart/) to learn more about usage.
